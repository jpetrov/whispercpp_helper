# whispercpp_helper
Add on scripts to use whisper.cpp on Linux/BSD machines

Copy in root of whisper.cpp project. Use: whisper_start.sh audiofile.mp3 output.txt

(audiofile.mp3 - the file you want transcripted, output.txt - the transcript file - target / save).

You have to install whisper.cpp [https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp] and ffmpeg [brew/apt/yum install ffmpeg] on your machine.
Tried and tested on MacOS.
